abstract: There has been an increased interest in discovering heuristics for
  combinatorial problems on graphs through machine learning. While existing
  techniques have primarily focused on obtaining high-quality solutions,
  scalability to billion-sized graphs has not been adequately addressed. In
  addition, the impact of a budget-constraint, which is necessary for many
  practical scenarios, remains to be studied. In this paper, we propose a
  framework called GCOMB to bridge these gaps. GCOMB trains a Graph
  Convolutional Network (GCN) using a novel probabilistic greedy mechanism to
  predict the quality of a node. To further facilitate the combinatorial nature
  of the problem, GCOMB utilizes a Q-learning framework, which is made efficient
  through importance sampling. We perform extensive experiments on real graphs
  to benchmark the efficiency and efficacy of GCOMB. Our results establish that
  GCOMB is 100 times faster and marginally better in quality than
  state-of-the-art algorithms for learning combinatorial algorithms.
  Additionally, a case-study on the practical combinatorial problem of Influence
  Maximization (IM) shows GCOMB is 150 times faster than the specialized IM
  algorithm IMM with similar quality.
