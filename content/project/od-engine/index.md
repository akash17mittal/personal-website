OD Engine is an API service to compute the most optimal paths between hundreds of pairs of location simultaneously. The current service is deployed for Singapore road network. It uses novel heuristics inspired by Contraction Hierarchies algorithm. The system works almost 10X faster than the existing geo informatics service. The service is being used by Vehicle Routing Problem solver.
