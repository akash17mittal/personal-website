OD Engine is an API service to compute the most optimal paths between hundreds of pairs of locations simultaneously. The current service is deployed for the Singapore road network. It uses novel heuristics inspired by the Contraction Hierarchies algorithm. The system works almost 10X faster than the existing geoinformatics service. The service is being used by a Vehicle Routing Problem solver.
