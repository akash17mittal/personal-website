**InNav**Â is an android application aimed at visually impaired people to assist in navigating inside indoor environments. It uses BLE beacons and WiFi signals to locate the user and geomagnetism for estimating heading direction. The system is deployed at one of the buildings in IIT Delhi. The application provides audio-based cues about the current location of the user and gives directions to the specified destination. The application's UI has been designed in such a way that visually impaired people can use it easily. The app opens on shaking the phone and the user can interact with it using voice commands.
