I am a master's student in [Computer Science department](https://cs.illinois.edu/) at the **University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)**. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Romit Roy Choudhury](https://croy.web.engr.illinois.edu/) at [SyNRG](https://synrg.csl.illinois.edu/) lab. I am currently working on [Earable Computing](https://synrg.csl.illinois.edu/earables.html) particularly focusing on healthcare applications of earables. Prior to joining UIUC, I spent three wonderful years at Samsung Research, Seoul.

Over the past few years, I have built and deployed end-to-end systems spanning multiple disciplines like **Mobile Sensing, Computer Vision, Deep Learning for graphs, Explainable AI, and Big Data** in various environments including academic research, as well as industry. I am passionate about solving the problems in the area of **Healthcare, Education, and Accessibility** using technology.
