I have several years of experience working on large scale machine-learning and data analysis tasks (AutoML platform, XAI, Big Data, Recommender systems, Time series analysis, Representation learning) in various environments including academic research, as well as industry. I love to build end to end systems/services that solve real world engineering problems. I am currently building infrastructure free smartphone based indoor positioning system.
