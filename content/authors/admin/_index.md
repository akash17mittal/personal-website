I am a software engineer at [Verkada's](https://www.verkada.com/) Search and CV team. I did masters in the [Computer Science department](https://cs.illinois.edu/) at the **University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)**. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Romit Roy Choudhury](https://croy.web.engr.illinois.edu/) at the [SiNRG](https://sinrg.csl.illinois.edu/) lab where I developed applications bridging the gap between [physical world and digital world](https://lenstalkai.web.illinois.edu/) (Fusing motion sensors and computer vision). I also worked with [Prof. Daniel Kang](https://ddkang.github.io/) on developing data systems for deploying Machine Learning models. Prior to joining UIUC, I spent three wonderful years at Samsung Research, Seoul.

Over the past few years, I have built and deployed end-to-end systems spanning multiple disciplines like **Mobile Sensing, Computer Vision, Deep Learning for graphs, Explainable AI, and Big Data** in various environments including academic research, as well as industry. I am highly passionate about solving real world problems using technology.
